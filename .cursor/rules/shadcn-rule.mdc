# Development Rules

## UI Components

1. **Always use the `shadcn` package, not the deprecated `shadcn-ui` package**
   ```bash
   # CORRECT ✅
   npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
   
   # INCORRECT ❌
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component-name]
   ```
## Dependencies

1. Use pnpm for package management
2. Keep dependencies up to date
3. Avoid unnecessary dependencies

## Code Quality

1. **Never add comments to code implementations**
   - Code should be self-documenting through clear variable names, function names, and structure
   - Avoid inline comments, function comments, or implementation explanations within the code
   - Focus on writing readable, expressive code instead of explaining unclear code with comments
